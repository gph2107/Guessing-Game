# Guessing-Game
This project contains major concepts of object-oriented concepts of java that we have learnt in the class.</br>
		This is a typical hangman game where the player is provided with hint and he/she needs to guess the answer letter by letter within limited chances.
This is a guessing game where the compiler randomly selects a hint/question from a pile of questions that we have already stored in the Questions.txt file.The partricipant will be given a total of 18 guesses.Based on the question/hint the player should guess the answer alphabet by alphabet.If the answer contains the alphabet,the empty balnk space will be filled with the letter you guessed at the suitable place.Also there will be the display of list of alphabets you have already guessed for the player's convinience.If you guess all the letters of the answer correctly within 18 guesses,you will get a message displayed on the console about the correct answer,or else you will get a message saying -'You Lose' along with the actual answer displayed.
